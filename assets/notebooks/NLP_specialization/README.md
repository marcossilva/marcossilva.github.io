## README

This folder contains all the notebooks obtained freely on github with the graded and ungraded exercises. It's separated in Unsolved and Solved folders. Although the original notebooks were already solved I've decided to keep track of both versions to ease the students that do not want the solution by others.

My solutions will be versioned on the Solved subfolder and what I believe are the original code will be available on the Unsolved folder. All the ungraded labs do not have code to submit, they are just explaining concepts or tools and therefore will be also versioned in their own folder, Ungraded Labs.

I would like to register my thanks to @sajid-r <https://github.com/sajid-r/NLP-Specialization> and @ak149 <https://github.com/ak149/Natural-Language-Processing-deeplearning.ai> that made their solutions available on github on the given links.
