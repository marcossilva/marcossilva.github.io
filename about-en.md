Hi! My name is Marcos Leal and I'm a Data Scientist at B2W. I currently work with SEO and Buybox. I am pursuing my masters degree at USP with the work entitled "Voice synthesis with Tacotron 2 with transfer learning and resources restrictions" only available in portuguese <a href="#">here</a>. I graduated in computer science at <a href="http://www.ic.uff.br/">UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense)</a> with the work entitled "Musical instruments detection with neural networks" available <a href="assets/pdf/2016.2%20-%20Marcos%20Pedro%20Ferreira%20Leal%20Silva%20-%20Detec%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20Instrumentos%20Musicais%20com%20Redes%20Neurais%20Profundas.pdf">here</a> in portuguese.
</p>

I have dynamic interests but most of the cross the related themes below:
* Neural Networks
* RNN, CNN, LSTM, GRU and many other kinds of neurons, layers and activations
* NLP (mostly because it was the main application of recurrent models)
* Image Recognition and mostly convolution
* Signal processing in general (FFT, DCT, 1DConv, 2DConv, 3DConv)
* Activation Layers 
* Datavis and dashboard building
